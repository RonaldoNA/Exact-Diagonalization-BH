# Bose-Hubbard Exact Diagonalization

This is a Julia exact diagonalization code on a Jupyter notebook for the [Bose-Hubbard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model) showing the variance and fraction of condensate in the model.

See [Zhang et al., 2011](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.4006v1.pdf).
