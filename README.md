# Bose-Hubbard Exact Diagonalization

This is a Julia exact diagonalization code on a Jupyter notebook for the [Bose-Hubbard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Hubbard_model) showing the variance and fraction of condensate in the model. 
Adding some order parameters as String and Parity order parameter.
